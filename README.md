 This project is for artists and web designers to work together and make Linux Mint look better.

Discussions
-----------

As much as possible, please be present on the IRC at #linuxmint-dev (irc.spotchat.org). In Linux Mint, open up Hexchat and type "/join #linuxmint-dev". On the web, connect to #linuxmint-dev from http://spotchat.org/connect/

Use https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-design/issues to discuss ideas, proposals, and to interact with other artists and developers.

Websites
--------

Some of the Linux Mint websites use common PHP solutions (WordPress for blog.linuxmint.com and segfault.linuxmint.com, PHPBB for forums.linuxmint.com), others are coded on top of PHP Frameworks such as CodeIgniter or even completely from scratch.

The development team is skilled in Web development but not in Web/Graphic design. In other words it's perfectly able to develop websites and to dress them with HTML/CSS. It's unable to make that look "pretty" though. That's where you come in and what this project is all about :)

Please create branches or pull requests to showcase your ideas/proposals. These can be screenshots, mockups, PSD/SVG designs in the early stage. Eventually, as we get close to using them, they'll need to be in the form of static HTML/CSS pages (i.e. real HTML but with dummy data.. no server-side dynamism).

The main page of linuxmint.com was exported to static HTML/CSS and placed in this project : https://github.com/linuxmint/mint-design/tree/master/websites/linuxmint.com. Paths were modified so it works locally in your browser after you git clone this project.
